Emailchef: the simplest recipe to cook amazing newsletters. Automatically synchronize form submissions from Contact Form 7, FSCF and Jetpack.

== Description ==

**Emailchef Mail Marketing Automation**

Send your email marketing campaigns through the interface provided on [Emailchef.com](https://Emailchef.com).
With Emailchef you can choose between multiple subscription plans divided by functionality and contacts and you can also decide to subscribe to a custom plan, built to suit your needs.

This is the perfect marketing tool to add an intuitive and solid email campaign solution to your website.

Every form submission from WPForms, Contact Form 7, Fast Secure Contact Form (FSCF) and Jetpack (more supported plugins coming: contact us for advices!) will be automatically synced with the selected Emailchef contact list.
It also supports customized fields you can use to segment your customers! E.g. if in a form you ask for customers type (reseller, hotels, etc.) you can easily create a newsletter just for them.
